# test-lifeaz-everydayHeroes

At Everyday Heroes, we give our users the possibility to declare their
interventions, carried out in real life, where they were led to perform gestures of
first aid. The goal of this interface is to be able to visualise their testimonies and share new ones.


Before starting you will need to create a `.env` file at the root of the back folder. 

For the back you will need to fill the following fields:
```
DB_USER = user for SQL database (use 'root' as default)
DB_PASSWORD = password for SQL database
DB_NAME = SQL database name
PORT = port you wish to use for your back
````

CORS is opened on all ports for testing purposes, please change it to your speficic front port before deploying it online, for security reasons.
